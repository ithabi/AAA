# AAA (Apprentissage Automatique et Analyse de données)

## Introduction
**AAA** is a machine learning project developed as part of the *Apprentissage Automatique et Analyse de données* course. The primary purpose of this project is to perform **regression analysis** to predict movie ratings based on a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

### Key Features:
- Uses **scikit-learn** for machine learning tasks.
- Focuses on **regression techniques** to estimate movie ratings.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle (requires a Kaggle account for access).

## Installation
### System Requirements & Dependencies:
- A **Kaggle account** (to download the dataset).
- **Google Colab** (recommended for running the project without local setup).

### Steps:
1. Open the project notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
3. When prompted, authenticate with your **Kaggle account** to download the dataset.

## Usage
1. **Open in Google Colab**: Launch the notebook in Colab to execute the regression pipeline.
2. **Dataset Access**: Ensure your Kaggle credentials are configured (follow prompts in the notebook).
3. **Run Analysis**: Execute cells to preprocess data, train the regression model, and evaluate predictions.
